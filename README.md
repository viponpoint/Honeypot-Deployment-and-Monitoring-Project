# Honeypot-Deployment-and-Monitoring-Project

## Objective

The primary objective of setting up this honeypot project using T-Pot on Digital Ocean is to create a sophisticated environment for detecting, monitoring, and analyzing malicious network activities. Honeypot is something that is easily accessible and attractive, this can be data services or systems, and the objective here is to detect unauthorized activity or to learn more about an attacker or simply distract them.

This setup serves several key purposes:

1. **Threat Detection and Analysis**:
   - **Capture Malicious Traffic**: Attract and capture various forms of cyber attacks in a controlled environment.
   - **Analyze Attack Patterns**: Study the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.
   - **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Discover common vulnerabilities exploited by attackers, which can inform security improvements.

2. **Improving Incident Response**:
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Utilize tools like Kibana and Attack Map to visualize and monitor malicious activities in real-time.
   - **Enhanced Response Capabilities**: Improve the ability to respond swiftly and effectively to detected threats.

3. **Security Automation and Integration**:
   - **Automate Threat Detection**: Implement automated processes for detecting and responding to attacks.
   - **Integrate with Security Tools**: Integrate the honeypot with other security tools and platforms to enhance overall security posture.

### Key Components of the Project

1. **Digital Ocean**:
   - **Cloud Infrastructure**: Utilize Digital Ocean's cloud platform to host the T-Pot honeypot environment, ensuring scalability and reliability.

2. **T-Pot Honeypot Framework**:
   - **Comprehensive Honeypot**: Deploy T-Pot, a multi-honeypot platform that includes various types of honeypots to attract different attack vectors.
   - **Data Collection**: Gather detailed information on attacks for analysis and research.

3. **Kibana**:
   - **Data Visualization**: Use Kibana to create dashboards that visualize honeypot data, making it easier to monitor and analyze attacks.
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enable real-time monitoring and alerting based on honeypot activity.

4. **Attack Map**:
   - **Geographical Visualization**: Provide a visual representation of attack sources and targets on a world map.
   - **Insight into Attack Trends**: Offer insights into the geographical distribution and trends of cyber attacks.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to significantly enhance the understanding of cyber threats, improve security measures, and contribute valuable insights to my cybersecurity knowledge.
